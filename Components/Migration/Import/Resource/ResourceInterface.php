     * - $this->increaseProgress() to increase the offset/progress
     * - $this->getProgress()->getOffset() to get the current progress' offset
     * - return $this->getProgress()->error("Message") in order to stop with an error message
     * - return $this->getProgress() in order to be called again with the current offset
     * - return $this->getProgress()->done() in order to mark the import as finished
